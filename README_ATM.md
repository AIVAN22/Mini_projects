ATM

This is a Python script that simulates the functionality of an Automated Teller Machine (ATM) using the tkinter library.
Requirements

To run this script, you need to have the following libraries installed:

    tkinter
    datetime
    time

You also need to have the ID_ATM.py file in the same directory, which contains the passwords dictionary.
How to use

    Clone or download this repository.
    Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where you saved the ATM.py file.
    Run the script with the Python interpreter:

python ATM.py

    Enter your credit card number and PIN when prompted.
    Follow the instructions on the screen to perform the desired actions:
        check balance
        withdraw money
        deposit money
        view transaction history
        transfer money
        exit

Note

The current implementation is a very basic simulation of an ATM and is not intended for production use. It is only for educational purposes.

Enjoy!
