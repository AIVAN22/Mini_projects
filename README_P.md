MP3 Player

This is a Python script that creates a simple MP3 player using the tkinter and pygame libraries.
Requirements

To run this script, you need to have the following libraries installed:

    tkinter
    pygame
    mutagen.mp3
    tkinter.ttk

How to use

    Clone or download this repository.
    Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where you saved the MP3_PLAYER.py file.
    Run the script with the Python interpreter:

python MP3_PLAYER.py

    Use the interface to perform the following actions:
        add individual or multiple songs to the playlist
        play, pause, stop, or skip to the next or previous song in the playlist
        adjust the volume with the slider
        delete individual or all songs from the playlist
        seek to a specific point in the song using the slider
        view the elapsed time and the total length of the song in the status bar

Note

The current implementation is a very basic MP3 player and is not intended for production use. It is only for educational purposes.

Enjoy!
